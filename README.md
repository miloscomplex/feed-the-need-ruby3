# FEED_THE_NEED

We, as a society, are more and more becoming cashless and dependent upon electronic transactions. A shortfall of this situation is that people in need are deprived; more frequently, people no longer have those couple of dollars or loose change in their purse or pocket to help them out. How can we address this while keeping it to a person-to-person basis instead of a blanket approach utilized by charities? Feed The Need. A web application that allows users to either sign-up for help or give support to those in need.

## Installation

Clone and download the entire repositories files to a local folder. In the terminal type:

```
git clone https://github.com/miloscomplex/feed_the_need.git
bundle install
```
To confirm you have the correct gem files.

Please note you will need to setup your own omniauth for google for it to function.

## Usage

In the terminal type:
```
rails s
```
This will initialize the rails server. Then open a web-browser with the URL [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to view the Feed_The_Need login page / registration page. Either use the credentials for a preexisting user or create your own.
